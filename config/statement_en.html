        Tsuro is played on <const>6</const>x<const>6</const> board. During the game players are placing square tiles
        on the board with different paths drawn on them. After the move, players are following the new paths created.
        Tiles are stored in tile deck, that consists of <const>35</const> tiles.<br><br>
        <strong>Tiles</strong><br>
        Player is placing tiles with 4 sets of paths. Path has 2 ends indexed as following:
        <br>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VizGhar/CG-Tsuro/master/src/main/resources/view/assets/indexes.png" width="200" height="200"/>
        </p>
        <br>
        So here you can see tile with some ID and indexes as follows -
        <const>0</const> <const>4</const>
        <const>1</const> <const>3</const>
        <const>2</const> <const>5</const>
        <const>6</const> <const>7</const>
        <br><br>
        <strong>First turn</strong><br>
        The active player places his or her marker on one of the start marks on the outside edge of the game board.
        Each tile has 2 path ends on each side, so there are 2 x 6 x 4 = 48 possible starting position. Starting
        position should be selected by calling <const>START</const> <var>column</var> <var>row</var> <var>index</var>
        <br><br>

        <strong>Game turn</strong><br>
        Game turn consists of 3 phases:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Placing single tile</li>
          <li>Move the markers</li>
          <li>Drawing tiles</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <strong>Placing single tile</strong>
        <br>
        During this phase player have at least 1 tile in his hand. He can place single tile from his hand on the board.
        The tile can be placed only at the end of player's current path. The tiles has id assigned and can be rotated
        clockwise <const>0</const>, <const>1</const>, <const>2</const> or <const>3</const> times and placed on the
        board. You can place the tile by calling <const>PLACE</const> <var>tileId</var> <var>tileRotation</var>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Move the markers</strong>
        <br>
        The active player moves his marker to the open end of the path.<br>
        All other players next to the new tile are moved to the ends of their new paths.<br>
        Any player that leaves the board will be eliminated.
        If more then one player is eliminated during resolution phase, active player is scored worse then inactive ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Drawing tiles</strong>
        <br>
        Tiles are drawn from the shuffled deck. Current player can have at most <const>3</const> tiles in his hands.
        If there are no tiles in deck remaining, player can have less then 3 tiles in his hand. This move is automated.
